# Domain Adaptation Enhancement Module (DAEM) for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection

## Overview

The Domain Adaptation Enhancement Module (DAEM) is an innovative component designed for cross-domain few-shot object detection tasks, focusing on improving model generalization to target domains. This module addresses domain differences through multiple mechanisms, enabling the model to effectively transfer knowledge from source to target domains, even with limited target domain samples.

## Key Features

DAEM provides the following core functionalities:

1. **Batch Enhancement**: Diversifies training samples through style transfer and data augmentation, reducing overfitting risk.
   - Style adaptation: Makes source domain images stylistically closer to the target domain
   - Color jittering: Randomly adjusts brightness, contrast, and saturation of images

2. **Feature Alignment**: Reduces differences between source and target domain feature distributions using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting domain-invariant feature learning.

## Installation and Dependencies

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MUXINTAI/MXT.git
   cd MXT
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python setup.py develop
   ```

2. **Required Dependencies**:
   - PyTorch >= 1.8.0
   - torchvision
   - detectron2
   - timm
   - numpy
   - opencv-python
   - pycocotools

## Pre-trained Models & Resources

This repository includes necessary files to reproduce our results:

1. **Pre-computed Background Prototypes**:
   - `background_prototypes.vits14.pth`: For ViT-Small/14 backbone
   - `background_prototypes.vitb14.pth`: For ViT-Base/14 backbone
   - `background_prototypes.vitl14.pth`: For ViT-Large/14 backbone

2. **Accessing Pretrained ViT Model Weights**:
   The code will automatically download the required DINOv2 ViT model weights from the official repository during the first run, or you can download them manually:
   ```bash
   # ViT-Large/14 DINOv2 Weights
   wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dinov2/dinov2_vitl14/dinov2_vitl14_pretrain.pth -P weights/
   ```

## Running Instructions

### 1. Reproducing Main Results

To reproduce our main experimental results across all datasets and shot settings:

```bash
bash main_results.sh
```

This script will run evaluations with our pre-configured settings and output results in the format described in our paper.

### 2. Training with DAEM

To train a model using DAEM with specific configurations:

```bash
bash run_daem.sh configs/dataset1/vitl_shot1_dataset1_finetune_daem.yaml
```

This script uses our domain adaptation enhancement module during training without modifying the original training script.

### 3. Manual Training

You can also directly call the enhanced training script and specify configuration files:

```bash
python tools/train_enhanced_net.py \
  --num-gpus 1 \
  --config-file configs/dataset1/vitl_shot1_dataset1_finetune_daem.yaml \
  MODEL.WEIGHTS weights/dinov2_vitl14_pretrain.pth \
  DE.OFFLINE_RPN_CONFIG configs/RPN/mask_rcnn_R_50_C4_1x_ovd_FSD.yaml \
  OUTPUT_DIR output/daem_vitl/dataset1_1shot/
```

### 4. Building Your Own Prototypes (Optional)

If you want to create background prototypes for your own datasets:

```bash
bash build_prototypes.sh
```

## Configuration Parameters

DAEM module provides several parameters that can be adjusted through configuration files:

- `DAEM.ENABLED`: Whether to enable the DAEM module
- `DAEM.STRENGTH`: Strength of domain adaptation enhancement (0.0-1.0)
- `DAEM.FEATURE_ALIGNMENT`: Whether to enable feature alignment
- `DAEM.MMD_WEIGHT`: Weight for MMD loss
- `DAEM.STYLE_WEIGHT`: Weight for style consistency loss
- `DAEM.WARM_UP_ITERS`: Warm-up iterations
- `DAEM.LR_MULTIPLIER`: Learning rate multiplier for DAEM
- `DAEM.BACKBONE_LR_FACTOR`: Learning rate factor for backbone
- `DAEM.BIAS_LR_FACTOR`: Learning rate factor for bias terms

## Performance Improvement

Compared to baseline models, the DAEM module significantly improves performance on cross-domain few-shot object detection tasks:

- Better domain adaptation capability
- More effective knowledge transfer
- Higher detection accuracy
- Better generalization performance

Our experiments show consistent improvements across different datasets and shot settings (1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot), with particularly significant gains in the challenging 1-shot scenario.

## Technical Details

DAEM implements several technical innovations:

1. **Progressive Domain Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts domain adaptation strength as training progresses
2. **Multi-scale Style Adjustment**: Adapts multiple aspects of image style to make samples closer to the target domain
3. **Feature-level Alignment**: Aligns source and target domains in feature space, not just at pixel level
